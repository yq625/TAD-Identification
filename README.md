# TAD-Identification

To identify the molecular topology of X chromosome and autosomes in C. elegans, I
generated genome-wide chromatin interaction matrix from paired-end (PE) sequencing
DNA captured by Hi-C methods. >>>>>  Interaction matrix building

To identify the degree of separation between the left and right regions at each Hi-C
matrix bin, the ‘insulation’ score of each bin in the matrix was calculated using the
function hicFindTADs of HicExplorer. >>>>>  Find Topologically Associating Domains (TADs)

Tracks used for visualization file. >>>>> tracks_0.05.ini
